## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using **React** with **TypeScript** and follows a component-based architecture. Key design decisions include:

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Uses Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Component Organization**: Modular components organized by feature (hero, curriculum, contact, etc.)
- **UI Framework**: Built on shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system including academic-themed color variables
- **State Management**: React Query for server state and local React state for UI interactions
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form processing

### Backend Architecture
The backend uses **Express.js** with TypeScript following a RESTful API pattern:

- **API Routes**: Simple REST endpoints for inquiry management (`/api/inquiries`)
- **Data Validation**: Drizzle-Zod integration for runtime type validation
- **Storage Layer**: Currently uses in-memory storage with interface for future database integration
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware with structured error responses
- **Development Tools**: Vite integration for hot module replacement and development server

### Data Storage Solutions
The application currently implements a dual-storage approach:

- **In-Memory Storage**: MemStorage class for development and testing
- **Database Ready**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL with schema definitions
- **Schema Design**: Simple inquiries table with fields for student information and educational background
- **Migration Support**: Drizzle-kit configuration for database migrations

### Design Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Storage interface allows switching between memory and database implementations
- **Component Composition**: Reusable UI components following single responsibility principle
- **Configuration-driven**: Centralized configuration for database connections and environment variables
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with shared schema definitions between client and server

## External Dependencies
